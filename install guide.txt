		"git clone -b Develop https://github.com/ProjetS4-Aimteam/Code-Aim-bot.git"
		
5 - Move the foler opencv-3.3.1-dev from "/catkin_ws/src/Code-Aim-bot" to "/opt/ros/kinetic/include"

6 - Catkin_make
	6.1 - cd into your catkin_ws folder
	6.1 - Execute the command "catkin_make"

7 - Start all
	5.1 - Go to "catkin_ws" folder and source your workspace
		"source devel/setup.bash
	5.2 - run the launch file
		"roslaunch filtre filtre.launch"

************** USER GUIDE *************************************************************
At this point, the robot should be plugged in and you should be connected to your raspberry pi via HDMI or VNC*

1 - Preparation for start command
	1.1 Open lxterminal in the start menu under System Tools
	1.2 Click on "File" and then " + New Tab"
	1.3 Go back to the first Tab
	
2 - Start the  system
	("" = To write as a command line)
	
	2.1 - move to catkin workspace 
		"cd catkin_ws/"
	2.2 - Start the main packgage
		"roslaunch filtre filtre.launch"
	
	2.3 Start the user Interface
		Switch to the other tab opened on step 1.2 of the user guide
		"rqt -s RQT_GUI.aimbot_gui_plugin.AimBotPugin"

	3.1 - Move to the 'Manual Control' Tab
	
	3.2 - From the drop menu on the top left, select the desired mode
		3.2.1 - STOP : You can move the Tilt and Pan angle but the launching wheels won't move
		3.2.2 - MANUAL : You can move the Tilt and Pan angle and start the launching wheels
		3.2.3 - AUTO : The robot will detect the next target and get ready to aim for it
		
4 - Automatic Mode

	4.1 - Calculate the distance in height between the top of the glass used and the flat base where the balls are launch from.
		(Typically it should be close to 0.07 m)
		
	4.2 - Follow the instruction under (3 - Mode Selection) and select AUTO.
			The Robot will start adjusting to aim for the first glass in sight.
			
	4.3 - When the target is aquired, click on 'LAUNCH' to destroy your opponent!
		
5 - Manual mode
	
	5.1 To change the Tilt angle, simply change the Tilt_angle value in the Manual Control window
		Min: 0, Max: 75
	
	5.2 To change the Pan angle, simply change the Pan_angle value in the Manual Control window
		Min : -10, Max: 10
	
	5.3 To change the launcher speed, simply change the Motor_speed value in the Manual Control window
		Min : 0, Max : 108
	
	5.4 To active the ball distributor, click on 'LAUNCH'
