Some information nice to know before starting the project

 - First, the Raspberry Pi runs on a ROS based image, nicely given by Ubiquity Robotics "https://ubiquityrobotics.com/". This image gives a pre-builded ROS structure for the RPi and is really useful to start quickly developing. We made you a step by step guide of how to configurate your raspberry pi for the occasion, it can be found into this repo under the name "install guide.txt".

 - The card used at a lower level is an OpenCR. Based and programmed with Arduino IDE, it still takes some tricky adaptation of the IDE to be able to push the first program into it. Robotis offers a very nice tutorial to help doing it: "http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/".

 - For all parts needed, you can go into the repository Hardware-Aim-bot of the user Aim-Team.
